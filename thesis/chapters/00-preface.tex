The idea for this research originally comes from the Open Webslides project and its many little side activities in development.
One of the things that has always fascinated me was how the platform would handle a massive influx of users, and specifically how it would relate to the non-critical data storage of the news items in the \textit{Recent Activity} feed.
I wanted to find out how a NoSQL data store would be integrated into the flow of data, and what kind of data store would be the most efficient, scalable solution for this problem.
My interest in this problem was also piqued by using the Neo4j graph database in a personal project, and how the data of the Open Webslides project would fit into the graph theoretical model as opposed to the relational model.
Digging into this subject while still maintaining my vision on the Ruby on Rails implementation in the platform allowed me to let the question bloom into this research paper.

This thesis was in part achieved by the support of Chantal Teerlinck, my promotor, who has given me many tips and tricks, and provided a framework for conducting a proper research.
Guy De Tr\'e, my co-promotor, also had an important influence on decisions taken in the research and development phase, being a person who is immersed in the academic world of relational and non-relational database management systems.
Finally, my friends and family also deserve recognition for helping me accomplish this paper, which is the culmination of three years higher education in a fast-moving and innovative field.
