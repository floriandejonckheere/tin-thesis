Ever since the rise of the NoSQL databases in 2009 \autocite{Sadalage2012} it has been a subject for vigorous academic and professional research. The contrast with relational databases, optimal use cases, performance and scalability are only some of the aspects that have been analyzed with great regularity. This chapter will summarize previous publications relevant to this thesis.

\textcite{Grolinger2013} present a use-case based approach to comparing different NoSQL and NewSQL data stores. The survey incorporates a feature-based comparison over different aspects such as querying, scalability and security, and analyzes these concepts in the context of a select number of NoSQL data stores.

The proceedings of the 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big data by \textcite{Kaur2013} describe the theoretical modeling and querying of SQL and NoSQL data stores. The paper then proceeds with a case study of a social networking site similar to \autocite{Malda1997}. Starting from an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), the researchers then proceed by modeling the entities in both a document and a graph database. Finally, a set of seven queries related to the use case is then drawn up and compared for the PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Neo4j data stores.
